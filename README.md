# Decoder-Ring-Capstone
Here is my Decoder Ring Project for the "Programming Fundamentals" Capstone

# Purpose
This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using three different cipher methods.

# Functionality 
The three ciphers available are the ceasar cipher, polybius square, and alphabet substitution ciphers.
It allows you to pass in messages and has fairly robust validation features to make sure the message will
come out correctly.

# Technology
This project was written in pure JavaScript ES6, utilizing mocha and chai for testing. It also has an HTML
front end using Bootstrap.

# Discoveries 
This was my first time using a regular expression to solve a problem, and through this project I learned more
about them and how they can be a useful to when searching through data.
